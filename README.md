# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

### Overview of the analysis
The purpose of the analysis or this project was first, to determine the employees retiring within the coming several years. 
After determining the employees retiring, taking employee data such as title, age, and the department they worked in, the enxt step was creating a mentorship program.
This mentorship program was to take in the retiring employees determined in first step, then determine current employees who are not retiring that might be eligible for mentoring by retiring employees.
So the next step was determining who of the current employees in the company are eligible. 

### Results
1. There are several thousands of employees retiring, with the majority of retiring employees being senior in their positions, and mostly senior engineers. So the next step for the company would be mentoring engineers mostly, where the majority of retiring are senior engineers.
2. The company has a high retention rate, as seen by the start date of the majority of employees who are retiring and available for mentorship.
3. The company should hire more employeees to replace the ever growing retiring employees.
4. The company should perhaps increase the number of employee eligible for the mentorship program to cover the number of retiring employees, with an emphasis on senior engineers. 

### Summary
1. There are perhaps 72,458 employees retiring as the "solver tsuname" begins, which was calculated throughout the challenge. 
2. There are enough qualified retirement-ready employees to mentor the next generation of employees, as the number of retiring employees is greatly more than employees available for the mentorship program.
